# Stock-market-prediction-using-Machine-learning-algorithms
This Project report offers a thorough examination of various machine learning models for stock market forecasting. On historical data from publicly traded companies, the effectiveness of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Auto ARIMA, and Prophet models was assessed in order to predict stock prices. Metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of these models. According to our findings, the LSTM model performs best at accurately forecasting stock values, outperforming all other models. This approach has demonstrated good results in earlier studies and is able to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. Due to its capacity to incorporate domain-specific knowledge as well as seasonality and trend data, the Prophet model also displays high accuracy. Auto ARIMA, which combines moving average and autoregression algorithms, performed admirably but had trouble handling non-linear data patterns. Although they had lower accuracy but quicker computation times, linear regression and KNN models were better suited for real-time applications. Additionally, we looked at how different parameters, such as the number of prior time steps used for prediction and the selection of hyperparameters, affected the performance of these models. According to our research, the best parameter values vary depending on the dataset and model being used.This study provides a comprehensive analysis of different machine learning models for stock market forecasting.

STOCK MARKET PREDICTION models was assessed using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Our results show that the LSTM model outperforms all other models in properly anticipating stock values. This method is capable of capturing long-term dependencies in time series data and has shown promising results in prior investig
